# Color_Sequencer
PureDate Sequencer based off RGB color code from Processing

In Puredata: click on "listen 6666" in upper area to initialize network listen, then click Bang above metro.
The number box beside that Bang subdivides metro for bpm (higher value = slower time)

In Processing: use up, left, and right arrow keys to lock color in Processing (down arrow launches random colors)
Mousing around Processing display will change color whose RGB code is then translated to 3 separate 8-bit binaries

In PureData: slide up volumes in lower left for 'kick', 'snare', and 'hihat' elements
